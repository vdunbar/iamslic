# What we do matters: Libraries, climate change, and transformation

> Every bit of warming matters, every year matters, every choice matters

-- IPCC

Inspired by the UN's IPCC core message, the The IAMSLIC 2023 conference theme is What we do matters: Libraries, climate change, and transformation.

Libraries and library workers support research and learning; building connections and supporting communities; and undertaking the transformative change that is needed in our communities, our institutions, and ourselves.  To achieve the “transformative systemic change” that the IPCC states as necessary, we need to imagine new futures, accelerate change, and most importantly, work together.
