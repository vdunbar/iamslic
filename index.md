Inspired by the UN's IPCC core message, the The IAMSLIC 2023 conference theme is **What we do matters: Libraries, climate change, and transformation.**

This theme speaks to the roles of libraries and library workers supporting research and learning; building connections and supporting communities; and undertaking the transformative change that is needed in our communities, our institutions, and ourselves.

We are all connected and the changes we make can have far reaching impacts. To achieve "transformative systemic change", we seek inspired approaches to investigate and imagine new futures, accelerate change, and most importantly, work together. Throughout the conference, we will explore how these core messages relate to libraries and library workers.

In British Columbia, we see this theme of tranformative change captured in the salmon, as a biological, and a culturally significant entity. Salmon transform throughout their life cycles, moving from stream to ocean to stream, and their health is closely tied to all of these places; inseparable from the health of resident killer whales, eagles, rivers, oceans, forests, bears, and human communities who rely on salmon for food but also culture and identity.

In 2022, heat and drought caused by climate change led to streams and rivers drying up and the death of thousands of salmon. Such events are expected to increase as we lose an estimated 95% of our glaciers this century, decreasing fresh water levels and increasing water temperatures. While we witness these changes and resulting impacts, there are efforts to prioritize and teach Traditional Indigenous Knowledge, restoration efforts, climate solutions, and climate justice.

Weâ€™re accepting presentation sessions and posters related to climate change, libraries, and the following:

- Action on climate change and biodiversity loss
- Justice 
- Impacts and adaptation
- Citizen science and monitoring
- Data and research
- Historical sources
- Access
- Traditional practice and knowledge 
- Restoration work 
- Change and transformation
- Library priorities and culture
- Community and collaboration
- Misinformation, disinformation, and information literacy
