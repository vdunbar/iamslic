# What we do matters: Libraries, climate change, and transformation

> Every bit of warming matters, every year matters, every choice matters

-- IPCC

Inspired by the UN's IPCC core message, the The IAMSLIC 2023 conference theme is What we do matters: Libraries, climate change, and transformation.

Libraries and library workers support research and learning; building connections and supporting communities; and undertaking the transformative change that is needed in our communities, our institutions, and ourselves.  To achieve the “transformative systemic change” that the IPCC states as necessary, we need to imagine new futures, accelerate change, and most importantly, work together. 

Throughout the conference, we would like to explore how these core messages relate to libraries and library workers, but we can also begin by thinking about salmon, who are an extremely important part of British Columbia, Canada, where the conference will be hosted. In 2022, for instance, heat and drought caused by climate change led to streams and rivers drying up and the death of thousands of salmon. Such events are expected to increase as BC loses an estimated 95% of its glaciers this century, decreasing fresh water levels and increasing water temperatures. This will have significant impacts on salmon, but also the health of many others. Salmon transform throughout their life cycles, moving from stream to ocean to stream, and their health is closely tied to all of these places. Salmon health is inseparable from the health of resident killer whales, eagles, rivers, oceans, forests, bears, and human communities who rely on salmon for food but also culture and identity. We are all connected and the changes we make can have far reaching impacts. In BC, while we see these impacts, we also see efforts to prioritize and teach Traditional Indigenous Knowledge, restoration efforts, climate solutions, and climate justice.
